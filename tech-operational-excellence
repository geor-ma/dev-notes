# Operation excellence in technology

### Tech stack and architecture - Goto stragegy 
 
    - business needs to change rapidly as per market needs. Technology should be able to deliver value in a sustainable and fast way.
      - simple, agile and maintainable code base.
      - minium automated process for sustainbility and rapid releases
    - public cloud with Infrastructure as service. e.g. No VMs or anything that needs specialized infrastructure management.
    - cloud-native, 
    - microservices, 
    - nail it and then scale it
    - early feedback loop through automation
    - hypotheis, build, measure, iterate
    - innovative and ownership midset and culture
    - put things in production as quick as possible
        - rollout to a few, then somemore and then everyone. 
        - automated rollback
        - feature flags


### Team composition and Skillsets

  - hire software engineers who can do both infrastructure as code and build software. 
    - Dont worry about the specific skillsets - hire engineers with right attitude and mindset. 
    - They build and deliver in a rapid changing business and technology changes 
  - goto skillsets and tools - 
    - react/angular (frontend), 
    - golang (apis), 
    - code runs in docker containers, 
    - serverless with google cloud run
    - more customized - K8s (auto pilot), Istio, Helm charts, private helm registry in gcp
    - docker images in private GCP artifacts registry
    - TF and Pulumi for IaC,
    - cloud build, codefresh for ci/cd
    - VS code with devcontainers
    - Github
    - sonarlint for immediate code feedback as you code.
    - sonarcloud for static code analysis.
    - security and license scan with Snyk (or similar tools)
    - Cloudflare for DNS, security and edge
    - 

### Onboarding engineers
- Hire only good engineers who can solve problems and build stuff with right toolsets
- Initial Pair programming until the engineer can run with it
